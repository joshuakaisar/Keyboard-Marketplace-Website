<h1>Keyboard Marketplace Website</h1>

<p>This project was to build a market place for custom mechanical keyboards.</p>

<h3>The Target Audience</h3>

<p>The target audience for the website would be your typical computer gamer or programmer. Anyone who spend hours on end typing into their keyboard and is looking for a better experience to further optimizer their workflow, while providing the exact sound signature and feeling of every keypress.</p>

<h3>Page Topics</h3>

<p>The pages consist of a homepage to introduce what boutique mechanical keyboard is to new shoppers on the website. Then is also a purchase page, providing information of different options in terms of keyboards, switches, plate material, as well as case material available for the new shopping and returning shoppers. The next page is where shoppers will be able to choose and customize their keyboard before adding it to their cart. Once it is added to the cart you will now be on cart page which is where you will finalize the purchase. Then there is an about me page introducing myself and why I have a vast interest in the custom keyboard community. Finally, there is a custom commissions page where customers will be able to order customer keyboard that go beyond the scope of off the shelf parts that require a special attention to detail.</p>
